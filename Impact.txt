Impact:

We designed our app with the intellectual progression of a child in mind.

We chose not to stop at helping children to learn their ABCs. (although we do expect our app to be very helpful in learning spelling, writing and reading, as intended).

What we are teaching them includes:

- Simple reading skills
- Expansion of vocabulary
- Some grammar
- Critical analysis
- Basic memory skills
- And also, some logic (e. g. adapting to different exercise types, such as graphs)

But all in all, we hope that children will have a fun time.

We chose stories that we find very readable and very enjoyable.

And we never assume that children know all and we tried to keep in focus, that children should be expected to learn from our app.
Not to show some hypothetical knowledge of reading or vocabulary
(e.g. word look-up, hints)

Originality and market fit:

Our initial market analysis showed that there are many apps dedicated to learning reading. All of which seem very decent.

While we don't aim to decimate our competition, we stand potential to take decent piece of the market share.

Our primary audience is children up to an age of 10, but we believe anyone can learn from it.

That's why we chose reading skills to be one of our priorities, but not our main one. We aim to help a child develop and we aim to
keep providing even when they're comfortable with reading, they can still learn from using our product.
(interesting reads, mild brain exercise, extensive vocabulary).

Scalability:

We built our app with scalability in mind.
As we chose android, we can easily distribute our app via Google Play.

We can endlessly extend our question set because we set up a database for our question set in the cloud.
New questions can just be obtained on the fly. And if we get an unexpectedly big customer base, we can just opt for a more powerful server.
Or optionally, a few servers, to ensure optimal uptime.

We can control the direction we are heading in, as we can easily:
- Add more questions to our levels
- Choose to opt for more levels while reflecting on our experience of what was successful

While, at this particular time we are not seeking any profit from our product (as we believe education to be a goal in and of itself),
we could potentially build a company around it. There's endless room and endless directions to expand it. Always something to expand:
- Adding more questions
- Adding/improving levels
- Addressing user feedback

Ways for achieving potential profit:
- Subscriptions for premium games
- Ads
- Ad-free paid app?
